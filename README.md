# Omar U. Espejel
**Technical Developer Advocate**

I scale developer ecosystems through code, education, and community.

## Track Record

**Starknet Foundation** (Current)  
Developer Advocate leading ecosystem growth
- Led Starknet Book to 800+ GitHub stars, primary resource for 1000s of Cairo developers
- Running Re{solve} hackathon across Bitcoin, Privacy/ZK, Mobile-first tracks
- Building privacy infrastructure: Tongo integration + ZK attestation toolkit
- Delivered technical workshops at ETHCC, Devcon, ETHPrague
- Secured ~75k USD in grants (Ethereum Foundation + Obol Collective) for Restake Watch

**Hugging Face** (Previously)  
Machine Learning Engineer / Developer Advocate
- Created 4 top-rated AI courses on Platzi (5-star avg across 325+ opinions)
- Authored core educational content: embeddings guide, model fine-tuning, fastai integration
- Scaled NLP adoption through hands-on tutorials and documentation

**Key Impact:** Took two nascent ecosystems (Starknet, Hugging Face) from early adoption to mainstream developer adoption through technical content, tooling, and community building.

## What I Do

**Technical Content:** I write code first, docs second. No hand-waving—working examples that developers can fork and ship.

**Ecosystem Building:** From developer documentation to hackathons to grant programs. I've built the full stack of developer relations.

**Code Contributions:** I ship production code. Cairo contracts, TypeScript SDKs, Python tooling. I understand what developers need because I am one.

**Community:** Host of Hacia Afuera, Spanish tech podcast. Built multilingual resources (ES/EN). Developer ecosystems are global.

## Technical Stack

**Current:** Cairo, Starknet, Zero-Knowledge (Noir, Garaga, Barretenberg), TypeScript, Rust  
**Previous:** Python, PyTorch, Transformers, NLP, Machine Learning

## Philosophy

Code over slides. Working demos over whitepapers. Open source over closed systems.

Developer advocacy isn't marketing—it's engineering that scales through education.
